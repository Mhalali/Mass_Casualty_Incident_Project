# MCI Bot (Mass Casualty Incident Bot)

This bot is designed to assist in training healthcare professionals for **Mass Casualty Incidents (MCI)** through realistic, voice-activated scenarios. The bot runs on **Discord** and helps simulate real-time triage, treatment, and transport situations using voice commands.

## Key Features

- **Voice-activated** scenarios for triage, treatment, and transport decisions.
- **Demo Mode**: A short 3-minute interactive demo allows users to experience the simulation.
- **Real-time Feedback**: Players can receive real-time guidance and updates based on their actions.
- Integrated with **Microsoft Azure Speech Services** for **Speech-to-Text (STT)** and **Text-to-Speech (TTS)**.

## How It Works

1. **Joining the Demo**:
   - Players can join the **Demo Channel** on Discord.
   - The bot will walk you through a simple triage and treatment scenario, guiding your decisions with voice commands.
   - You have **3 minutes** to complete the demo, after which the bot will automatically end the session.

2. **Game Master Setup**:
   - The GameMaster can set up roles and channels for full simulations using simple bot commands.
   - Full scenarios can be tailored based on specific training needs, providing healthcare professionals with immersive practice.
